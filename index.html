            <p>"Job creation isn’t just about employment—it’s about unleashing human potential. Instead of training young people to look for jobs, we must inspire them to create jobs. Every individual has the capacity to be an entrepreneur. By building systems that nurture creativity and innovation, we can solve unemployment and poverty simultaneously. Let’s focus on empowering people to turn their ideas into businesses that benefit themselves and their communities. The future of our economy depends on bold thinkers who turn challenges into opportunities for all."</p>
